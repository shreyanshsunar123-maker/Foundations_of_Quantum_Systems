## Perturbation Theory
In quantum mechanics, exactly solvable systems are rare. Most physical systems differ slightly from idealized models, leading to small corrections in their energy spectra and wavefunctions. Perturbation theory provides a systematic way to approximate these corrections when the deviation from an ideal system is sufficiently small.

The central idea is to express the true Hamiltonian as a sum of an exactly solvable part and a small additional term:
the solvable part captures the dominant physics, while the additional term accounts for real-world effects neglected in the ideal model.

# Schrödinger Equation and the Harmonic Approximation

 For a particle bound by a spring-like restoring force, the potential energy is well approximated by a quadratic function of position. Solving the Schrödinger equation with this harmonic potential yields a discrete set of energy eigenvalues and corresponding wavefunctions. These solutions form a complete and orthonormal basis and serve as an excellent approximation near the equilibrium position.

 However, this harmonic description is only valid when the particle remains close to the minimum of the potential. At larger displacements, real physical systems deviate from perfect quadratic behavior, and the harmonic approximation begins to break down.

# Perturbative Corrections to Energy

 To account for deviations from ideal harmonic motion, an additional term is introduced into the potential. When this term is small compared to the harmonic contribution, its effect on the energy levels can be approximated using perturbation theory.

 In first-order perturbation theory, the correction to the energy of a given quantum state is obtained by taking the expectation value of the perturbing potential with respect to the unperturbed wavefunction. This correction shifts the energy levels without immediately altering the functional form of the wavefunctions.

 Because higher-energy states extend further in space, their expectation values of higher powers of position grow rapidly. As a result, the perturbative correction increases with the quantum number, even when the perturbing potential itself remains small near the origin.

# Anharmonicity and the Breakdown of Perturbation Theory

 The inclusion of higher-order terms in the potential, such as quartic contributions, introduces anharmonicity. Anharmonic effects represent genuine physical behavior present in real systems, including molecular vibrations and lattice dynamics.

 While perturbation theory successfully captures anharmonic corrections at low energies, it eventually fails at higher energies or larger spatial regions. In these regimes, the correction becomes comparable to or larger than the base harmonic energy, violating the assumption that the perturbation is small. When this occurs, perturbation theory no longer provides reliable results, and non-perturbative or numerical methods must be employed.

# Summary

 Perturbation theory bridges the gap between idealized quantum models and real physical systems. It is most effective when deviations from the ideal model are small and localized. Anharmonicity illustrates both the power and the limitations of this approach, highlighting the necessity of numerical and exact methods when corrections grow beyond the perturbative regime.
