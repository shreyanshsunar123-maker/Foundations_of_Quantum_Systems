## Physical and Numerical Assumptions

1. The spatial domain is truncated to a finite interval [-L, L].
Wavefunctions are assumed negligible at the boundaries.

2. The grid spacing Δx is finite, introducing discretization error.

3. Units are chosen such that ħ = m = Ω = 1.

4. The finite difference approximation assumes smooth wavefunctions.

Convergence is expected as N → ∞ and L → ∞.
